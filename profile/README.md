# Ring DAO

Ring DAO is a tooling for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that innovates by using ring signatures. This unique approach allows the toolkit to provide privacy to DAO members through token-gated authentication based on ring signatures.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication:** Ring DAO leverages ring signatures to enable token-gated authentication, allowing members to interact with the DAO without revealing their individual identities.
- **Secure Voting System:** The project also innovates by incorporating ring signatures into the DAO's voting system, enhancing the privacy and security of the decision-making process.
-  **Decentralized Governance:** Ring DAO is designed to empower DAO members with a decentralized governance model, where decisions are made collectively and transparently.
-  **Metamask Snap Integration:** Ring DAO leverages the Metamask Snap API to seamlessly integrate the ring signature process into the user experience, providing a familiar and secure way for members to authenticate and vote within the DAO.

## Ring Signatures 
Ring signatures are a type of digital signature that provide anonymity and privacy for the signer. The signer creates a signature using their own private key, but their identity is hidden within a "ring" of multiple public keys.

Key features of ring signatures:

- **Anonymity**: The signer's identity is obfuscated within the ring of public keys.
- **Unforgeability**: Only a member of the ring can create a valid signature.
- **Efficiency**: Ring signatures can be generated and verified efficiently.

Ring signatures have applications in areas like confidential transactions, whistleblowing, and e-voting.

For this project, we utilize [Alice's Ring LSAG TS library](https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-LSAG-TS), a TypeScript implementation of the ring signature algorithm.
