## Ring DAO

Ring DAO is a tooling for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that innovates by using ring signatures. This unique approach allows the toolkit to provide privacy to DAO members through token-gated authentication based on ring signatures.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication:** Ring DAO leverages ring signatures to enable token-gated authentication, allowing members to interact with the DAO without revealing their individual identities.
- **Secure Voting System:** The project also innovates by incorporating ring signatures into the DAO's voting system, enhancing the privacy and security of the decision-making process.
-  **Decentralized Governance:** Ring DAO is designed to empower DAO members with a decentralized governance model, where decisions are made collectively and transparently.
-  **Extensibility:** The toolkit is built to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy integration with various blockchain networks and DAO management tools.
