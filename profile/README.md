# Ring DAO

Ring DAO is a tooling for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that innovates by using ring signatures. This unique approach allows the toolkit to provide privacy to DAO members through token-gated authentication based on ring signatures.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Authentication:** Ring DAO leverages ring signatures to enable token-gated authentication, allowing members to interact with the DAO without revealing their individual identities.
- **Secure Voting System:** The project also innovates by incorporating ring signatures into the DAO's voting system, enhancing the privacy and security of the decision-making process.
-  **Decentralized Governance:** Ring DAO is designed to empower DAO members with a decentralized governance model, where decisions are made collectively and transparently.
-  **Metamask Snap Integration:** Ring DAO leverages the Metamask Snap API to seamlessly integrate the ring signature process into the user experience, providing a familiar and secure way for members to authenticate and vote within the DAO.
